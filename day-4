"""
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, 
and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge , as a parameter. 
The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; 
if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, 
the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. 
In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age < 13, print You are young..
If age between 13 and 18 , print You are a teenager..
Otherwise, print You are old..
