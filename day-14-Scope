Complete the Difference class by writing the following:

1) A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it to the elements instance variable.
2) A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in N 
   and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
