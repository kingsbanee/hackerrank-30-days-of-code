Complete the code in the editor below. The variables i, d, and s are already declared and initialized for you. You must:
1. Declare 3 variables: one of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.
2. Read 3 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the Input Format section below) and initialize your  variables.
3. Use the + operator to perform the following operations:
   1. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.
   2. Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal place on a new line.
   3. Concatenate  with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.
