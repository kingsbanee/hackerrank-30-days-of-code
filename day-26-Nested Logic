"""
Your local library needs your help! 
Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). 
The fee structure is as follows:

1. If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine = 0.)
2. If the book is returned after the expected return day 
   but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date, fine = 15 hackos x (number of days late).
3. If the book is returned after the expected return month 
   but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the fine = 500 hackos x (number of months late).
4. If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos.
